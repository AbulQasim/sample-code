During the recently held Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View, California, “Generative AI” got the maximum attention. Bard, a rival of Microsoft-backed ChatGPT AI chatbot, received special attention as Google seeks to make up for lost ground in Artificial Intelligence technology.

Google’s Bard, just like ChatGPT, can understand and generate human-like responses. With Bard now available to users in more than 180 countries worldwide, including India, Google is ready to show a new way of how we search the web in future.

What is Bard?
Bard is basically an AI Chatbot developed by Google. It is based on Google’s Large language model (LLM), LaMDA, similar to how ChatGPT is based on GPT. These are types of neural networks that mimic the underlying architecture of the brain in the form of a computer. Bard is separate from Google Search, which is the default way how billions of people look for information on the web. Unlike how a traditional search works, Bard is conversational and allows users to write a prompt and receive human-like text and images generated by artificial intelligence.

In its own description, Bard is a “large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive”. “I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.”
